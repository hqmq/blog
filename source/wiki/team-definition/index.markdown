## Team Definition
When discussing strategy and tactics for team building it is worth defining the edges of what I mean by "the team".
Most often when I talk with developers they tend to refer to their team as the people in charge of writing code.
Sometimes their team includes a project manager or some other kind of manager that is involved in the detailed decisions of writing the code.
Certainly in [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) there is a push to include the customer as a member of team.

When I discuss "the team" on these wiki pages I am referring to everyone involved in getting the project delivered to the end user.
For most of the teams I have worked on this includes at least:
* Customers/Business Owners - who make decisions about the relative value of various features and scheduling decisions
* Developers - who write code
* Operations - who manage the server and sometimes manage part or all of the release process

The key take away from this definition of team is that you should consider each of these people as being vital to your project's success.
If you hate the operations guys and they hate you, there will definitely be problems with releasing.
It doesn't matter how good your Continuous Integration is, or how many tests you write.
This idea can be tied to something like [People Patterns by Joe O'Brien](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1140-scrc2012-people-patterns).
