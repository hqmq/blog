## Geek-O-System
I have decided to take control of my blog by

## Intentions
One of the main intentions of this blog is to document and evolve my understanding of programming patterns.  Specifically as I spend time writing RubyMotion code I want to document which patterns I find useful.  I'm sure they will be different than the patterns that I found useful in writing server applications.

I also intend on finding and reading some good reference material that talks about client-side MVC patterns. I'll do my best to update the names of the patterns as I start to learn their actual names in this reference material.  If you know of a good client-side patterns book please let me know.
