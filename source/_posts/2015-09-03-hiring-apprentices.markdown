The [MX](http://mx.com/) apprenticeship has been a lot of work and fun so far.
This blog post is the beginning of an effort to document what I've learned along the way.

# The Goal

I initially got interested in the idea of an apprenticeship while listening to the [ruby rogues episode with Joe Mastey and Jill Lynch](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/190-rr-apprenticeship-with-joseph-mastey-and-jill-lynch-of-enova).
I help organize a [local ruby meetup group](http://utruby.org/#uv.rb), so I liked the idea of helping new engineers.
I also love my job at MX and want to see the team grow.

My early motivation was focused on facilitating the learning that comes with a first professional programming job, but I knew that goal of the apprenticeship needed to be focused on the company sponsoring it.
I decided that the primary objective was to __add amazing engineers to the MX team__.

# Amazing People

Based on my experience in the local Ruby community, I believed there were some really amazing programmers who were self-taught that were struggling to find a first job programming.
I also met many bootcamp graduates with the same problem.

The shortage of senior engineers at pretty much every company has made it really difficult to get a job as a junior developer.
Lots of companies think they can't hire junior engineers because they don't have enough senior people to train them.
There are also serious bias issues throughout the software industry and especially in the hiring processes.

This is not scientific research, but it seemed there was a large pool of extremely talented and hard-working people that was underutilized.

# Teaching

On our team we usually only considered hiring someone if they had a full year of professional programming experience.
This is partially because our team has no managers and no task assignment so it is easy to get lost in the weeds if you don't have your own discipline for staying focused as an engineer.
But this meant that if we wanted to make an apprenticeship work for us, we needed  the apprentices to have a skill and experience level similar to someone with one full year of professional experience.

But I didn't think it should actually take a year to gain that experience and those skills.

It is all too common for people to have a first programming job where they get assigned a laundry list of bugs and work alone [spending lots of time](http://www.happybearsoftware.com/how-to-survive-your-first-year-as-a-programmer.html) on just a few small conceptual misunderstandings.
In my own experience my first two jobs wasted a lot of time because the experienced people on the team were too busy to provide guidance on which things were worth learning and which things I should skip until later.
I rarely got feedback on my projects unless they broke something in production.

I'm not qualified to write a decent curriculum, but I think that we can deliberately make a lot of time for smart people to talk through what they are learning.
I think that with this kind of feedback the apprentices will significantly outpace the rate at which I learned things as a new developer.
I also think that by hiring apprentices in a group and giving them tasks as a group, they will do a lot of learning as a team.
This will help prepare them for the very chaotic and collaborative environment on the MX engineering team, and also speed up their learning because they spend time teaching and learning from people with a similar experience level.

Based on the two ideas above we planned a mentorship model where each apprentice has a mentor assigned.
This direct mentor has between 1 and 3 years of professional experience and sets aside one hour each day to helping their apprentice.
The apprentice should ask for the type of help that they think will be most helpful to them.
They might ask to pair program, answer a specific programming question, figure out a bug or go on a walk and discuss a career in software.
The point is to give as much control as possible to the apprentice and let the mentor provide feedback.
We also have a "senior mentor" that changes each week.
The senior mentor gives 90 minutes of their week to each apprentice with the same basic premise as the direct mentor.


# Knowing The Audience

We had a lot of discussions internally about who we wanted to bring in as apprentices.
Would we consider hiring people with no programming experience at all?
Did long-term potential mean more than their current skill set?
What evidence of long-term potential were we looking for?

The biggest concern that I had was that we might hire people as apprentices, spend 3 months of their time, 3 months of our time and not be able to teach them enough to be successful engineers on our team.
That was pretty much my definition of failure.

To mitigate this risk we decided to aim our apprenticeship at people with enough programming experience that they could build some sort of a web-based [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) app.
We preferred experience in Ruby because that would be the tool they would be using in the apprenticeship.

We decided that once someone had met that minimum bar we wanted to heavily weight our decision towards long-term potential.
The evidence we would look for was a track record of being self-motivated to learn new things and tackle hard problems.

This was still a somewhat ambiguous criteria, but we were comfortable with the ambiguity because we knew that we were going outside the normal hiring practices. We already had a hypothesis that using those standard practices had left a large pool of awesome engineers struggling to get a job during the first few years of their careers.

# The Plan

At this point we had a few ideas about who to teach and how to teach them.
None of these ideas were founded on research or expertise.
What could go wrong?
In typical developer fashion we assumed we could significantly change outcomes by applying just a few simple rules to a complex system.

Despite the lack of credentials for these ideas, I continued to feel convinced that running an apprenticeship in this way would have made my early development life a lot better. Surprisingly my company went along with the idea and we started planning for an apprenticeship that would run from September to December 2015.
