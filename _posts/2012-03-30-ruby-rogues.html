Have you ever watched a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">http://www.confreaks.com/</a>&nbsp;presentation that just blew your mind? &nbsp;Something like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.confreaks.com%2Fvideos%2F717-rockymtnruby2011-opening-keynote-code-blindness&amp;ei=pWh2T_2kCsaeiALfqKCoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTHjP6P3x3mflfY_chs_Kshtppvg" target="_blank">Code Blindness</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dqyz3jkOBbQY&amp;ei=yGh2T_HVGaWqiQKm7dinDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4nU3v8k-e0-T8EreTb0UNLH4sXg" target="_blank">How Github uses Github to build Github</a>&nbsp;(language warning)?<br /><br />I love that feeling of realizing, "why haven't I tried that before?" &nbsp;That sense of learning something new is my favorite thing about the ruby community. &nbsp;In the spirit of that sense of awesome learning I highly suggest&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Rogues</a>.<br /><br />This podcast has several of my favorite rubyists that I follow and it even has some fellow Utahns that I hadn't known about before. &nbsp;In addition to that they have guests on the show like Jim Weirich and Kent Beck. &nbsp;Can you say, "scream like a nerdy fan-girl!"<br /><br />I started by listening to their most recent podcasts and quickly went back to start at the beginning and get caught up on the backlog of podcast episodes. &nbsp;They have a great mix of common themes with differing opinions that leave me feeling like, "why haven't I ever done that before?"<br /><br />If you love programming, you will love the podcast. &nbsp;Go Ruby Rogues!</div>
